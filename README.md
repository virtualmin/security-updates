# security-updates [DEPRECATED]
Webmin module to make it easy to list and install available security updates, with Virtualmin integration

This module has been merged into the core Webmin package, as "package-updates". There's still some old links to security-updates within Virtualmin and themes currently, but they'll be factored out over the next few versions. Any new development should happen in the [Webmin repository](http://github.com/webmin/webmin).
